## [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)

Simultaneous Localization And Mapping is a techonological mapping method which allows the robot to simultaneously navigate itself and map the location while travelling in an unknown environment.

A LiDAR-based SLAM system uses a laser sensor to generate a 3D map of its environment.

My attempts to implement LiDAR SLAM in matlab.
